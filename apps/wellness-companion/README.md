## Bloom Daily Edition

Bloom is an adaptive energy coach that turns wearable syncs and reflections into actionable rituals. The refreshed demo captures how a consumer wellness app can feel premium while staying grounded in data.

### Experience Highlights
- **Wearable snapshot logger** collects readiness, sleep, HRV, and tags while tracking trends in real time.
- **Adaptive journal** encourages daily reflections with mood scoring and keeps a running log for coaches.
- **Recovery timeline & micro-reset kit** blend proactive nudges with tailored prompts pulled from the shared library.
- **Persona-forward dashboard** uses gradients, stats, and sparklines to sell the portfolio-ready polish.

### Running the demo
```sh
# at the workspace root:
npm run dev:bloom
```

The script boots the API and Expo dev server together. If Metro caching causes issues, re-run with:

```sh
npx expo start --clear --workspace @multiapps/wellness-companion
```
